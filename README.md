# Car-Booking
Reason for the team -each team member has various skills and knowledge which helps the team with balancing workload and assigning different roles and responsibilities.

Group goals = To create a high-quality online car booking(reservation) website where users can go make an account to make reservations for cars at their desired time and location. 

It displays all the available cars on the home page from the database whereas the users cannot view unavailable cars until and unless the user returns the rental car. 
-	The project is divided into two categories: Customer Login and Employee Login. In an overview of this web app, the employee has full control of the system. Talking about the project, a customer can simply log in or register their accounts. 
-	He/she can view available cars, select any one and proceed for rental after selecting various conditions, dates, etc. After all, the customer can rent a car by filling up the given forms.
-	The customer can view all his rental records and history once after logging onto the system. In addition, the customer needs to return the cars using the system because all the records are carried throughout the system. At last, the system prints an invoice stating all the information with total costs.
Employee Panel
-	Similarly, an employee plays the main role in implementing the system. An employee has the right to view all bookings, drivers, and cars. 
-	To add a car for rental purposes, an employee must provide a car name with its number plate, fare-related information, and car image too. Also, for adding driver records, he/she must provide his/her name with driving license number, contact information, and gender. 
-	Last but not least, an admin can view all the system data such as bookings, car details, availability, and driver information.
